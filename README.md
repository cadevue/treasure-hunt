# Project Description 
A web application that solve the treasure hunt problem using Breadth First Search (BFS) and Depth First Search (DFS) algorithm. The application visualize how a ship traverse the ocean (grid-based) map to find the treasure using the two algorithms.

The technologies used for the application are:
- **React** as the frontend framework
- **Typescript** as the language
- **Vite** for the frontend bundler
- **TailwindCSS** for the styling
- **Vercel** for the deployment
